# AM2R-Scarlet-Ridley-Manual-APworld
An unofficial Manual randomizer for Haihaa's unofficial Ridley mod, Scarlet Ridley, for the unofficial continuation of the unofficial Metroid fangame, AM2R. Be careful, this APworld can be quite difficult!

IMPORTANT: This APworld WILL NOT generate as a solo game due to there being more items than checks. Therefore, this APworld is only compatible with Multiworld sessions with, at minimum, 8 filler checks.

Requirements:
- AM2R 1.1
- AM2RLauncher 2.3.0
- Scarlet Ridley 1.1
- Archipelago 0.6.3 (newer versions not tested)
- The skill to defeat Hellfire Ridley

Goal:
Go defeat Hellfire Ridley whenever you feel like it. Yes, it's that simple. No, it won't be easy considering you realistically need every randomized progression item in this randomizer to defeat him.

The following items must be toggled off before you obtain them. For the Missiles and Super Missiles, you will need to keep track of how many you've fired and stop using them whenever you're supposed to run out to the best of your ability.

Randomized Progression:
- 19 Missile Tanks each worth 5 Missiles
- 5 Super Missile Tanks each worth 1 Super Missile
- Charge Beam
- High Jump Boots
- Space Jump
- Varia Suit

Randomized non-progression:
- Wave Beam
- Spazer Beam
- Plasma Beam
- Ice Beam

Note: The other major upgrades that are not listed above were deemed too niche or straight up useless to be randomized, thus meaning you can always use them in-game.

Randomized Checks:
- Defeating individual phases on every difficulty
- Speedrunning individual phases on every difficulty (Hellfire Ridley phase 3 not included)
- Winning on each difficulty with a 100% Performance Rating (no-hit run) (Hellfire Ridley not included)
- Speedrunning phase 1 and 2 in very quick times (Hellfire Ridley not included)
- Completing that one Spiky Room in between Hellfire Ridley's second and third phases because why not

Note: For defeating phases, speedrunning and 100% Performance Rating, if you get a check on a higher difficulty, you automatically get all the checks for the same challenge on lower difficulties. However, this rule DOES NOT apply to Hellfire Ridley Phase 2 since it is much shorter than the other Phase 2's.
